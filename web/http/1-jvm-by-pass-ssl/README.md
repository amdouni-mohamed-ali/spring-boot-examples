# Project Title

Avoid SSL validation in Java

## Overview

In this example, we will configure our jvm to avoid any ssl verification.
The JVM contains a default Trust Store that contains standard well-known certificates. So in this example we will use a fake trust store
that accepts any certificate without any verification.

### Prerequisites

Java 8 or above

### Building

After cloning the project, you can build it from source with this command:

```
mvn clean package
```

### Running the application

you can run this application using java -jar, as shown in the following example:

```
java -jar target/1-jvm-by-pass-ssl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

or using the spring boot maven plugin :

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Built With

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) v3.6.0 - Dependency Management


### Running the tests

There is no junit tests in this example. We've created our test in the runner package. We've implemented the Springâ€™s CommandLineRunner interface
 so after you start the application the test will be executed automatically and you can check the logs after.
