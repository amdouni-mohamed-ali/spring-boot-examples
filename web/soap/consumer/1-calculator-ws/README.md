# Project Title

calculator soap web service consumer


## Overview

In this example we will learn how to consume a SOAP web services using spring boot soap client and auto client proxy class generation using JAXB maven plugin.
The WebServiceTemplate is the core class for client-side Web service access in Spring-WS. It contains methods for sending Source objects, and receiving response messages as either Source or Result. Additionally, it can marshal objects to XML before sending them across a transport, and unmarshal any response XML into an object again.
So the JAXB will be used to marshall/unmarshall our xml request/response.

In this example we will use a public soap web service used to do some basic calculation. you can find it at :
* http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?wsdl

I will download the wsdl ,save it in a file and then copy it in the resources of the project (it will be used bu jaxb).

I've created a soap interceptor so we can log all of our soap requests and responses.

### Prerequisites

Java 8 or above

### Building

After cloning the project, you can build it from source with this command:

```
mvn clean package
```

### Running the application

you can run this application using java -jar, as shown in the following example:

```
java -jar target/1-calculator-ws-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

or using the spring boot maven plugin :

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Built With

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) v3.6.0 - Dependency Management


### Running the tests

There is no junit tests in this example. We've created our test in the runner package. We've implemented the Springâ€™s CommandLineRunner interface
 so after you start the application the test will be executed automatically and you can check the logs after.
