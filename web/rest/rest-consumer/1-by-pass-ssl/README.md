# Project Title

Avoid SSL validation in Spring RestTemplate

## Overview

In this example, we will set up a RestTemplate without the SSL Certificate Validation. So we've used an online https rest service
[https://reqres.in/api/products/3](https://reqres.in/api/products/3) to do the test.
We gonna create an http interceptor to log our RestTemplate requests and responses.

### Prerequisites

Java 8 or above

### Building

After cloning the project, you can build it from source with this command:

```
mvn clean package
```

### Running the application

you can run this application using java -jar, as shown in the following example:

```
java -jar target/1-by-pass-ssl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

or using the spring boot maven plugin :

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Built With

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) v3.6.0 - Dependency Management


### Running the tests

There is no junit tests in this example. We've created our test in the runner package. We've implemented the Springâ€™s CommandLineRunner interface
 so after you start the application the test will be executed automatically and you can check the logs after.
