# Project Title

Externalize configuration files of a war application

## Overview

In this example, we will externalize the application.yml and the application-profile.yml files of a spring boot application. Our delivery file is war.

### Prerequisites

Java 8 or above

### Building

After cloning the project, you can build it from source with this command:

```
mvn clean package
```

### Installing

Before you run the application you must place the config files in an another directory of your computer
(you can find this files in resources) then you must initialize a system property or an environment property called CONFIG_DIRECTORY_LOCATION
with the full path of this directory.

### Running the application

you can run the application using a web server like tomcat. If you choose tomcat, you should copy/paste the generated
war target/2-ext-config-files-war.war in {APACHE_HOME}/webapps.

### Built With

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) v3.6.0 - Dependency Management


### Running the tests

There is no junit tests in this example. We've created our test in the runner package. We've implemented the Springâ€™s CommandLineRunner interface
 so after you start the application the test will be executed automatically and you can check the logs after.

You can also check this url -[http://localhost:8080/2-ext-config-files-war/actuator/info](http://localhost:8080/2-ext-config-files-war/actuator/info)- to know the loaded platform.
