# Project Title

Externalize configuration files of a jar application

## Overview

In this example, we will externalize the application.yml and the application-profile.yml files of a spring boot application. Our delivery file is jar.

### Prerequisites

Java 8 or above

### Building

After cloning the project, you can build it from source with this command:

```
mvn clean package
```

### Installing

Before you run the application you must place the config files in an another directory of your computer
(you can find this files in resources/config) then you must change the SPRING_CONFIG_NAME property in the Application.java file
with the full path of this directory.

### Running the application

you can run this application using java -jar, as shown in the following example:

```
java -jar target/1-ext-config-files-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

or using the spring boot maven plugin :

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Built With

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) v3.6.0 - Dependency Management


### Running the tests

There is no junit tests in this example. We've created our test in the runner package. We've implemented the Springâ€™s CommandLineRunner interface
 so after you start the application the test will be executed automatically and you can check the logs after.
